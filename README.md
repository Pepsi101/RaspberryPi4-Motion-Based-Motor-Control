# RaspberryPi4-hands on Projects

Project 1: Controlling of DC Motors using MPU-92/65- a 9-axis motion  processing unit 


This Project is designed to provide the basic idea to control a DC motor using the MPU-92/65. By moving the sensor in an upward or downward direction, the direction of the motors will be changed. How to control a DC motor using l298N motor driver.


Project 2: Introducing servo motor along with push buttons and LEDs with Raspberry Pi
   
This Project is designed to provide the basic idea to control a DC motor using the Servo Motor(SG-90). By moving the sensor in an upward or downward direction, the direction of the motors will be changed. How to control a DC motor using a Motor driver.


Project 3: Measuring Distance Using Ultrasonic Sensor

This project focuses on measuring distance using an ultrasonic sensor with the help of a Raspberry Pi. This lab aims to demonstrate how to use an ultrasonic sensor with Raspberry Pi to measure distance accurately. This task consists of Raspberry Pi 4 setup, wiring the ultrasonic sensor with Pi, writing Python script for controlling the sensor, demonstration of the project, and documentation.
